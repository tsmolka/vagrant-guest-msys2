        Renaming the MSYS2 guest failed. Most often this is because you've
        specified a FQDN instead of just a host name.

        Ensure the new guest name is properly formatted. Standard names may
        contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and hypens (-), but no
        spaces or periods (.). The name may not consist entirely of digits.
